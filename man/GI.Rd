\usage{
GI(ma, sig_u, imp_var = 1, unit = "sd")
}
\arguments{
\item{ma}{a list, it's MA coeffients from \code{ar2ma}}

\item{sig_u}{a cov matrix from VAR models. Note the order of variables in \code{sig_u}
is same with one of \code{ma[[i]]}.}

\item{imp_var}{a numerical scalor which specifies the impulse variable.}

\item{unit}{\code{'sd'} is one standard devtiation shock which is default,
and \code{'one'} is one unit shock.}
}
\value{
a data frame, its row is variables and its coloumn is horizons.
